# FAKE-NEWS-CLASSIFIER-APP 🗞️


<h3>What is fake news and its negative concequences ?😶 </h3>
<bl>
  
Fake news is false or misleading information presented as news.It often has the aim of damaging the reputation of a person or entity, or making money through advertising revenue. However, the term does not have a fixed definition, and has been applied more broadly to include any type of false information, including unintentional and unconscious mechanisms, and also by high-profile individuals to apply to any news unfavourable to their personal perspectives.

  <h3>What is our aim ? 🎯</h3>

Hence this project aims to solve this problem by identify whether the given news is fake or real using Deep Learning Techiniques.

  
  <h3> Which Deep Learning architecture are we using and why ?🤔 </h3>
The model used to solve this problem is LSTM.

Long short-term memory (LSTM) is an artificial recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture used in the field of deep learning. Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, LSTM has feedback connections. It can process not only single data points (such as images), but also entire sequences of data (such as speech, video or text).
  
  As our data is a sequential data we prefer to use LSTM network.

  <h3>Which framework is this app built on ? 🏢</h3>
